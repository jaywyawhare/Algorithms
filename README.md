# Algorithm Repository

This repository contains implementations of different algorithms and sorting techniques. Each algorithm or sorting technique is organized in its own directory, which includes a question.md file describing the problem statement or algorithm, a Makefile for compilation, and a src directory containing the source code files.

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Bucket Sort
- Counting Sort
- Heap Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort
- Selection Sort

## Dynamic Programming
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Matrix Chain Multiplication

## Greedy Algorithms
- Activity Selection
- Fractional Knapsack
- Huffman Coding
- Knapsack


## Usage

To use an algorithm from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jaywyawhare/Algorithms
    ```

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired algorithm:
    ```bash
    cd Algorithm/Algorithm-1
    ```
    Replace `Algorithm-1` with the name of the specific algorithm you want to use.


1. Read the `question.md` file:
    The `question.md` file provides a description of the problem statement or algorithm, explaining what it does and how it works.

1. Compile the source code:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

    The `Makefile` included in each algorithm directory is responsible for compiling the source code and generating an executable or compiled files.

1. Run the algorithm:
    ```bash
    ./<executable_name>
    ```

    Replace `<executable_name>` with the name of the generated executable file or follow language-specific instructions for running the code.

1. Follow the prompts or examine the output:
Depending on the specific algorithm, you may need to provide input or the algorithm may generate output. Follow the instructions provided in the program or examine the output produced.

    Remember to repeat these steps for each algorithm you want to use from the repository. Additionally, make sure you have the necessary dependencies and programming environment set up to compile and run the code.
